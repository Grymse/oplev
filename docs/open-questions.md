# Open Questions
Keeping track of open questions acknowledges and keeps track of them. This way we can plan around these, and understand which questions should urgently be answered and which ones we do not have to stress about.

1. Once the front-end is finished, which customer segment, should I start focusing on?
2. Should we centralize around a single platform with multiple festivals/programs, or supply a solution for each festival?
3. How do we address the legal rights of distribution material about artists?
4. How should the internal editor tool look, and what level of complexity should this be?
5. What should a potential price-model look like?
