# Projects and subtasks
This document outlines the projects needed to setup a basic platform that can show the relevance of swipe-based interaction with cultural experiences. First is to implement a tool that is functional for music festivals. Next up is to find a market where the platform can grow. Once grown successfully, the platform need to be extended into a general-purpose platform that is suitable for both public and private events.

## Web Application
There should be given no thought to anything but creating a platform that serves multiple festivals programs and allows users to interact with each other by sharing likes and superlikes, chatting and creating a group. The following milestones, are to be focused on

### Forward
Going forward is not yet known. For now, it is about implementing the above and understanding the type of needs that we meet, such that we can structure some form of sales strategy, for those events who would benefit from an improved program navigation.


## Industry research
This is a particularly open questions, but the idea should be present in our minds. How do we progress from simply showing a couple of festivals into a world of multiple events, that find relevance in this type of tool, such that we can grow a suite of tools.
