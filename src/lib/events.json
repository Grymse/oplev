Behind the artist name is the singer and songwriter Maria-Louise Lundqvist, whose vision consists only of shadows and light. Often, other people's considerations turn into a pity that makes her feel misunderstood, which the listener understands when struck by the beautiful, detail-oriented, and uncompromising songwriting. Drawing inspiration from Sebastian and Guldimund, Ria Qvist is a present and honest storyteller who tells stories that intrigue in a completely different way.</p>\n",

ATHELAS consists of 16 musicians, each of whom is characterized by their desire and ability to work with innovative projects that break aesthetic barriers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Li-Ying Wu </strong>(b. 1978) is originally from Taiwan, but has lived in Denmark since 2003, where she studied composition at the Royal Danish Conservatory of Music and electronic composition at DIEM in Aarhus. Wu has written music for a large number of Danish and international ensembles, orchestras and choirs. Her music explores sound and its evolution through composition, engaging in a dialectic of ideas that offers a reciprocal perspective on both Asian and Western culture.</p>\n<p>Trained in piano and composition, <strong>Matias Vesterg&aring;rd Hansen</strong> (b. 1989) is a versatile composer who moves fluidly between large dramatic musical works and chamber music. In the autumn of 2017, he premiered the ballet &lsquo;THE FORGOTTEN CHILDREN&rsquo; at the Royal Theatre, and since then he has premiered several operas at, among others, Copenhagen Opera Festival and the opera in Helsinki. In 2023 he won a Reumert for his opera &lsquo;LISBON FLOOR&rsquo; and in the same year he received the Young Artistic Elite from the Danish Arts Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>Icelandic B&aacute;ra G&iacute;slad&oacute;ttir </strong>(b. 1989) is a composer and double bassist based in Copenhagen. Her work is generally based on thoughts about the approach and the concept of sound as a living being. G&iacute;slad&oacute;ttir has worked with a large number of Danish and international ensembles, and has received several awards for her work, most recently The Ernst von Siemens Music Prize 2024. She is also an active musician and regularly plays her own music solo or with her long-time collaborator Sk&uacute;li Sverrisson, as well as double bass player in Elja Ensemble.</p>\n<p>Composer <strong>Mette Nielsen</strong> (b.1985), trained in composition from the Royal Danish Academy of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, works with ensembles of all sizes, soloists, choirs and orchestras. In April 2023, she had her first orchestral piece performed by the Odense Symphony Orchestra, and the same spring the album &lsquo;Frozen Moments&rsquo; was released with the NOVO Quartet and Jonas Fr&oslash;lund with her string quartets and works for the basset clarinet.</p>\n<p><em>The concert is part of SPOT FLUX, a collaboration between the Danish Composers' Society and SPOT Festival, which presents new orchestral music in a new setting. SPOT FLUX is presented in collaboration with Art Music Denmark and is supported by the Augustinus Foundation.</em></p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

Together, they write songs that everyone needs when the emotions of everyday life become too overwhelming to face alone. These are stories about the fear of growing up, long-distance relationships, and playing too hard-to-get to message your crush. In January 2023, the duo released their debut EP, &lsquo;Kradser Ik&rsquo; L&aelig;ngere Mine H&aelig;nder&rsquo;, taking the listener on a journey from a broken heart to finally becoming their own main character again. iiris is not afraid to share aspects of their private lives, making the lyrics personal and sincere, yet humorous and unpretentious. For iiris, melodies are a crucial element in their songs, and as a listener, it's hard not to sing along to the playful choruses and hooks.</p>\n<p>iiris has performed at events such as SEEK, RAMA festival, and most recently, SPOT, in a packed R&aring; Hal at Godsbanen, earning much praise from an audience that laughed and cried throughout the show. On stage, iiris is known for both the simple duo setup and the grand nine-person band, including strings, backup singers, and a VJ. Their concerts are intimate, intense, humorous, and filled with gimmicks and sing-along moments that are hard to forget.</p>\n<p>Presented by The Royal Academy of Music</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

The orchestra's vision is to create sympathetic communities through classical music, and to be the city's ambassadors to spread classical music to new audiences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stine Benjaminsen</strong> (b. 1990) is a Danish composer and performer. Her compositions are often built around poetry, where text is included either directly as lyrics, or indirectly as inspiration to create the music. She investigates timbre in intuitive and sensuous compositions where the music insists on a slowness and openness, and illuminates the simple and fragile. Stine is inspired by human relationships, nature, and connections/contrasts. She has written music for choirs, classical ensembles, electronics, chamber music and vocal music and has collaborated with visual artists and art museums.</p>\n<p>Composer, librettist, music producer and performer <strong>Louise Alenius</strong> (b. 1978) works interdisciplinarily with score music as a starting point and has created over 100 musical works, including two operas, three ballets, orchestral works, film music, 15 performance works, hybrid works based on e.g. augmented reality and 3D sound, several choral works, and a large number of songs, three album releases, and installation works/sound art. Alenius is concerned with ethical and society-related themes and has created award-winning dramatic musical works about e.g. euthanasia, modern rituals, power relations, incest, and life in a prison. She has received a number of awards, including Carl Nielsen and Anne Marie Carl Nielsen's Honorary Award.</p>\n<p><strong>Magnus Plejdrup</strong> (b. 1995) is a Danish composer and conductor based in Aarhus. He is the artistic director of the Aarhus Chamber Orchestra and part of the artistic management behind the Aarhus Chamber Music Festival. He has studied composition at the Royal Academy of Music (2018-21) and conducting at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Plejdrup has had works performed by a number of Danish ensembles and has received several awards, including Carl Nielsen and Anne Marie-Carl Nielsen&rsquo;s Talent Prize 2023 and Leonie Sonning's Talent Prize 2022.</p>\n<p><em>The concert is part of SPOT FLUX, a collaboration between the Danish Composers' Society and SPOT Festival, which presents new orchestral music in a new setting. SPOT FLUX is presented in collaboration with Art Music Denmark and is supported by the Augustinus Foundation.</em></p>\n",

A mesmerizing world of eternal sunlight, long embraces from someone you love and unconditional comfort. The band's emotionally charged shoegaze manages to convey all that and more and their latest releases is a vibrant message of what the members are capable of and ends up somewhere in between Beach House and DIIV, with a distinctive electronic touch. On the horizon is their debut album set for March 15th, shows at New Colossus Festival in New York, SXSW in Austin and, of course, Spot Festival in Aarhus.</p>\n<p></p>\n",

Although her unique musical language as a composer and singular improvising style are easily identified, she is difficult to place in the kanon of contemporary jazz and composition. This is partly due to the broad spectrum of her influences and also because her music goes beyond stylistic definitions and into the realm of the deeply personal. Today Maria Faust is one of the most celebrated and established Estonian musicians of all time, recipient of numerous awards and prizes from Estonia and Denmark (where she resides), but also a celebrated artist all over Europe and slowly but surely catching the attention of American audiences.</p>\n<p>Maria Faust&acute;s Jazz Catastrophe was originally founded in Copenhagen in 2012 as a modern big band, and the current album documents its third mutation. Concentrated and reduced down to its essence like a thick syrup, the new music is performed by a trio where Maria Faust&acute;s alto saxophone is flanked by long-time associates Lars Pilgaard on guitar and Anders Vestergaard on drums.</p>\n",

The release followed two previous singles and confirmed her unique talent, which had already garnered attention for the young artist, both in Denmark and on the international scene. Rebebe's voice is almost provocatively full of presence, insistent, and dynamically alive with unexpected intonations, constantly shifting between confident power and anxious vibrato. With lyrics drawn from reality, Rebebe puts words to her own life, everything that comes to mind, what she sees, encounters, and observes. It is music without filters, censorship, and other algorithm-friendly limitations. The singer's latest release is the EP 'Deserving,' which came out in 2023.</p>\n",

Growing up in the countryside in S&oslash;nderborg, he draws inspiration for his music from his upbringing. The lyrical universe is based on personal experiences, revolving around deeply felt, down-to-earth subjects that cut straight to the heart. The sound offers catchy choruses with space for both dancing and reflection. The production is built on a smoldering and pulsating soft-house '4-on-the-floor' vibe. All carried by KEDDE's unique voice, blending the lyrical and instrumental elements.</p>\n<p>His latest single, 'S&aring;dan M&aring; Det V&aelig;re,' describes a relationship that doesn't work &ndash; a relationship one didn't choose: the family relationship. It's about the sad acceptance that things don't change because that's how it has always been. In the verses, KEDDE zooms in on his own life, portraying the specific scenario where he stands right outside the door about to enter a place where he doesn't feel at home. In the chorus, he zooms out, precisely describing the feeling and singing to everyone: 'It is what it is, and that's how it must be. We don't want to be here &ndash; but that's how it must be.'</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

And it works - both Lykke Li and Tessa have praised his talent, and in 2022 Asbj&oslash;rn was featured on the single &lsquo;Farver&rsquo; with the latter.</p>\n<p>His inspiration stretches from classical music and folk, which his parents played when he was a child, to Destiny&rsquo;s Child, Britney, and Michael Jackson, whose songs he used to choreograph dance routines to when he came home from school.</p>\n<p>Asbj&oslash;rn's latest album, &lsquo;Boyology&rsquo; (2022), featured collaborations with PC Music&rsquo;s Danny L Harle (Charli XCX, Caroline Polachek, Dua Lipa) and Planningtorock (Lady Gaga, Robyn).

		"description": "<p>Omar has had an extraordinary musical journey.At the age of 9-10, he released songs on YouTube and gained local fame under the name Omar Nr1Bandit. It was clear early on that he would continue making music. In 2017, he released his first single under the name Omar and quickly gained popularity due to his unique vocals and minimalist UK productions. In a time dominated by gritty street rap in the Danish urban scene, Omar stood out as a breath of fresh air. Stories of rising from the bottom sounded more adventurous and less dangerous in Omar's unique packaging.</p>\n<p>After more than 15 singles and an EP, Omar took a short break from music to rediscover himself. When he returned from his self-imposed hiatus, the productions were more significant and the sound more pop-oriented. He found a new look and sound that was both authentic and forward-looking. At the same time, his ambitions with music grew bigger. It's no longer enough for Omar to demonstrate that he can create music that streams well. Omar wants to prove that his music is ready for the live stage.&nbsp; It's a side of Omar that people haven't seen yet. He is finally ready to unfold and tell his entire story.</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

On holiday, you don&rsquo;t take yourself too seriously. You lower your guard, meet new people and drink an extra cocktail, letting out all the pent up emotions and awkward anecdotes. And in many ways, this is exactly the essence of The J&uuml;rgen Clubs, according to the frontman of the group, Magnus Grilstad.</p>\n<p>Since The J&uuml;rgen Clubs released their first single &lsquo;You Never Take Me Anywhere, James&rsquo; (2022) the informal indie rockers have established themselves on the Danish music scene with their catchy, energetic and humoristic tracks. GAFFA highlighted the band in the annual piece &lsquo;De bliver store&rsquo; (&ldquo;The Next Big Thing&rdquo;), and P6 Beat have been playing the singles &lsquo;Shiver&rsquo; and &lsquo;Daddy Was a Player&rsquo; more than 400 times. </p>\n",

Growing up in Denmark with a Danish father and Japanese mother, IDA KUDO incorporates influences from her ethnic roots, creating a unique Scandinavian-Asian mix with a British touch in production, alongside Andrew Hunt. The result is an eclectic blend, embracing hip-hop attitude, 50s orchestration, and vocals ranging from graceful harmonies to chanting tribal choirs. All wrapped up in solid pop with a powerful vocal at the forefront.</p>\n<p>IDA KUDO's music has been featured on BBC Introducing, DR P3, P4, and P6 BEAT, as well as on radio channels in Germany and France. Several of her previous releases, such as 'Gold,' 'Jinx,' and 'Wolf,' have been used in TV series like Netflix's 'Selling Sunset' and in major international campaigns for brands such as Starbucks, Victoria's Secret, and Audi.</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

And everything is done independently, in a music industry that is dynamic and constantly changing. The music is difficult to pigeonhole, and embraces a wide range of sounds and themes - but most of all, it tells stories from growing up, guides the young and honors the cultural background of the rapper, who turns 30 this year.

With a weighty heritage of references derived from the ecstasy and carefree nature of the late 2000&rsquo;s and early 2010&rsquo;s, the work of Neon Priest manages to evoke the grand emotions of escapism and club-euphoria.</p>\n<p>A trance-pop love child wouldn&rsquo;t be an insufficient description of the Copenhagen-based quartet, who guested last year's SPOT Festival and recently released their powerhouse club tune &lsquo;Bandage Toss&rsquo;. When performing their high-energy live shows, Neon Priest are on a quest to dissolve time and space, ceaselessly renewing and reinterpreting their own works, while immersing you into their pulsating biome.</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

Seeking to transform daily observations and interrogations into hauntingly beautiful and crafted records, her poetic and sharp lyrics oscillate between singing and spoken words in distinctively emotionally driven combinations of electronic music and analog instruments. <br />At SPOT you will get the chance to hear some of her new music. &lsquo;Interior&rsquo;, her third solo album, was released early 2024, and is Rosa Ansch&uuml;tz&rsquo;s most introspective and vulnerable album to date; an insightful and powerfully crafted album which dives within but also urges to turn to the outside.</p>\n<p>The record operates as a meditative sonic and lyrical journey across genres, with an analog dark-romanticism rooted in the melancholia of neo-folk, the elegance and solemnity of modern classic and the grace and baroque of sacred music.</p>\n<p>Along the nine tracks of the record, this faith is looked for within the difficult lessons of heartbreak, natural beauty, family ghosts, the mysticism of spirituality. <br />It is partly found in the traverse flute, the trumpet and the organ. The instruments emphasize Ansch&uuml;tz&rsquo;s cold and delicate singing and reciting, the entirely analog composition of &lsquo;Interior&rsquo; setting Rosa&rsquo;s voice and lyrics as the genuine backbone of the album.</p>\n<p>It establishes Rosa Ansch&uuml;tz as a stunningly talented artist, poet and singer-songwriter, whose sharpness gives her the courage to look at what lies within herself to then dare you to look at what she is, at last, observing.</p>\n",

These folk songs are at the core of the music. As a reflection of Teitur's childhood in the Faroe Islands and his youth in Denmark, the material is based on old Faroese rhymes and melodies, which he and Girls in Airports have reinterpreted in radically new directions, drawing on genres such as jazz, electronic, and indie.</p>\n<p>With two Danish Grammy Awards, over 1000 concerts, and 8 studio albums under his belt, Teitur has proven his talent for capturing the listener in an intense and seductive grip.</p>\n<p>Girls in Airports distinguish themselves with an enormous openness to genre, sound, and expression and are in many ways ambassadors for new jazz. Collective creativity is a big part of the group's DNA, and in recent years they have immersed themselves in artistic collaborations, which, in addition to the collaboration with Teitur, has resulted in the ambitious work 'Leap' composed for Aarhus Jazz Orchestra.</p>\n",

The four musicians reclaim the repetitive work usually given over to machines, using this work as a calibration of the mind. The use of repetition allows the listeners and the players to immerse themselves fully into the depths of the rhythms.</p>\n",

They perform music by women, non-binary and trans people and experiment with collective co-creation of music based in art music - from improvisation to opera to performance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Composer, vocalist and performer <strong>Randi Pontoppidan</strong> (b. 1970) is, among other things, known for her experimental mix of vocal work and electronic live processing of the voice. In her work 'DEMIURGE', Pontoppidan explores the demiurge, who is the Platonic and Gnostic deity who shapes the material world, based on her voice and Damkapellet's instrumentation.</p>\n<p>With a particular interest in the body and movement, the work of instrumentalist, composer and performer <strong>Kirstine Lindemann</strong> (b. 1987) revolves around the space between you and me. With the orchestra, Lindemann has prepared a version of 'Further & Back', which includes the musicians' voice and breathing and adds a primitiveness and physicality to the piece.</p>\n<p>Violaist and composer <strong>Pauline Hogstrand </strong>implements structures in cyclical and extended forms in her solo works. The work 'Chants' is immediate and bodily, a musical ritual that seeks to meet the audience in both challenging and conciliatory ways, in close co-creation with Damkapellet.</p>\n<p>British/Swedish composer <strong>Greta Eacott</strong> (b. 1990) is known for her uninhibited approach to composition and her experimental percussion works. The work 'Gestalt Minimal III' was composed for Damkapellet in 2020 and although the overall aesthetic can be considered 'dark', the work is a love song that perhaps conveys an alternative point of view on romance.</p>\n<p><em>The concert is part of SPOT FLUX, a collaboration between the Danish Composers' Society and SPOT Festival, which presents new orchestral music in a new setting. SPOT FLUX is presented in collaboration with Art Music Denmark and is supported by the Augustinus Foundation.</em></p>\n",

It is liberatingly free from clich&eacute;s while simultaneously genuine and well thought out. The predominantly traditional Swedish folk music is dressed in everything from contemporary art music to EDM-inspired riffs, and the result is its very own sound, which feels both brave and refreshing.</p>\n<p>The musicians in R&Aring; combine the melancholic seriousness of the polskas, the suggestive rhythm of the waltzes, and the playful swing of the polkas and create a whole that challenges the listener, while harboring great love and respect for the musical heritage they uphold. With its unusual lineup consisting of violin, clarinet, and saxophone, the sound becomes an exciting and fresh addition to the Nordic music scene.</p>\n",

'Bedre' also marks the beginning of a new release phase for Bette, with new collaborators inside and outside the studio, and new music at the forefront of her agenda for 2024. 'Bedre' takes us into the peculiar time after a breakup, where one tries to convince oneself that everything will be okay again. Perhaps even better. But also how the self-imposed confidence that arises can, at times, make one doubt what the truth really is. Am I better now, or am I just pretending?</p>\n<p>In addition to her regular musical collaborator, Johannes Wamberg, she has since invited songwriter August Fogh (GUZO) and the producer duo T&O into Bette-land. This new mix of people opens up a more outgoing sound, embracing the listener with strong hooks while maintaining Bette's knack for intuitive play with words and melodies. In true Bette style, the production is carried by curious R&B textures that support a lyrical universe unhesitatingly setting the agenda for Bette's own life.</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

Astrid Engberg's music spans modern soul, R&B, nu jazz, and modern classical music, inviting the listener into a world of both minimalist and heavy productions, personal stories, and spiritual exploration. Her enchanting voice expresses both genuine sensitivity and profound strength.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2024, she will take the critically acclaimed album (featured in Politiken, GAFFA, Information, and more) on tour to Danish venues. Her debut album 'Tulpa,' listed by Bandcamp Daily as one of the best albums in 2020, also garnered national recognition when she won \"&Aring;rets Bedste Vokaludgivelse\" (Vocal Release of the Year) at the Danish Music Awards Jazz and the Steppeulven for \"&Aring;rets Producer\" (Producer of the Year).</p>\n<p>On her debut album 'Tulpa,' Astrid expressed her mental and physical recovery after a head injury that still affects her daily life over a decade later. On 'Trust,' Astrid celebrates intuition and motherhood with all its facets. She collaborates with various Nordic talents such as Maria Dybbroe, Tobias Wiklund, and J. Ludvig III, as well as Los Angeles-based Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, an esteemed multi-instrumentalist, conductor, and composer. The album took shape after the birth of her first child and was created with playful joy, openness, and gratitude over a period of nine months.</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

Her songs are guaranteed to kickstart conversations about taboo topics in everyday life after a concert.</p>\n<p>On stage, Aya Vedige is hard to ignore, as she shapes musical scenarios with a wealth of emotions and real-life sounds. The listener is invited on an awkward 'solo' trip to Street Food, to a club with a hunger for skin, and on a road trip with an ex-boyfriend afraid of the new tick-borne disease. In the spring of '22, she debuted with her first EP on a small tour in Jutland, including performances at Aarhus Musikhus, the grand &Aring;rhundredets Festival, Skr&aring;en in Aalborg, UnderSpot, and 1000fryd. The EP was recommended by KarriereKanonen, played in London, Berlin, Colombia, and featured in publications such as Ud&Se, Aarhus Stiftstidende, and an interview with Uniradioen. Since then, she has performed numerous concerts in both Copenhagen and Jutland.</p>\n<p>Presented by The Royal Academy of Music</p>\n",

The album reflects the fact that Jesper Nohrstedt Boesgaard is one of the country's greatest songwriting talents and vocalists, with the single 'N&aring;r Det Br&aelig;nder' being the first release from it. The song is a well-crafted pop anthem with a grandiose and 80s-inspired chorus that, once heard, lingers throughout the day.</p>\n<p>After releasing a mini-album in the summer of 2022, Jesper chose to step back from Dusin and focus even more on his career as a songwriter. This decision resulted in several top-50 tracks and gold and platinum certifications ('All In' &ndash; Bl&aelig;st x Lamin, 'Stiv Kuling' (EP) &ndash; Bl&aelig;st, and others), elevating his songwriting to a new level. Slowly, the urge to create music under his own project, Dusin, returned, leading to late-night sessions in his home studio on &Oslash;ster Voldgade. Accompanied by Mads Vadsager, the creation of an album began, proving to be the most ambitious and cohesive to date.</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

In 2022, Kaizer won TAK ROCK's live competition and performed at Smukfest's LiveCamp. In 2023 she followed up with a support tour for Dopha, and last year she made her debut at SPOT Festival&mdash;recognized by Soundvenue as one of the 10 highlights from Saturday's program. In March of this year, Kaizer also made her headlining debut to a packed VEGA in Copenhagen, so she is ready to take on SPOT once again. Kaizer is particularly characterized by blending Scandinavian pop tradition with audacity and grunge energy, as seen on her latest dance hit \"Kurt Cobain\"&mdash;perhaps you've already heard it on the radio?</p>\n<p>In live performances, Kaizer is a collaborative project, further complemented by bassist Magnus Ram Pedersen, drummer Lasse Herold Krarup, and guitarist Daniel Larsen.</p>\n",

Gugusar is also not afraid to jump between writing in Icelandic and English, and sometimes she just hums and sings in no language. Her music is experimental and there is no telling what is around the corner when you listen to her music.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Icelandic Gugusar produces and writes all her songs on her own. She released her debut album &lsquo;Listen To This Twice&rsquo; when she was only 15 years old, and her second album was released in 2021. Both albums were nominated in the category &lsquo;Album Of The Year&rsquo; at the Icelandic Music Awards.&nbsp;Gugusar began performing at a very young age as a figure skater. There, she fell in love with performing and being on stage, in front of crowds. Her love for performing on ice was transcended by performing her own music on stage. It is obvious in her musical performances that she was once a figure skater when she dances on stage. Gugusar sometimes choreographs dance routines and uses them to elevate her performance.</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

Prior to her departure, she managed to record the sessions for the album 'White Dwarf,' which was subsequently completed following the instructions she had left behind. The album was posthumously released in October 2023. It is a creation of an uncompromising artist who, through her whimsical lyrical universe and detailed compositions, presents stories of being a stubborn wingman, a darkly humorous nostalgic trip to a bygone era, strong portrayals of women, and, notably, her journey through illness. A beautiful and deeply personal album, with grand gestures that pay homage to icons like Bowie and Lennox.</p>\n<p>A group of prominent singers, who&rsquo;s also close friends, and colleagues of Maya Westman have come together to bring her songs to life on the live stage, an opportunity she did not have herself. With a solid band comprised of musicians from Westman's band, they will interpret the songs from 'White Dwarf' into a unique concert experience during SPOT 2024.</p>\n<p>The soloists include Nanna Schannong (Lowly), Stine Gr&oslash;n (IRAH), Bess Barkholt (BESS), Terkel Atsushi R&oslash;jle (Atusji), Mathias Bertelsen (The Entrepreneurs), Tania Ballentine (LadyJerk), Lo Ersare (Lucky Lo), Greta Schenk (GRETA), Kaspar Vig, and Camilla Munck.</p>\n<p>The band consists of Greta Schenk (GRETA), Gertrud Hjelm Kongsh&oslash;j, Ida Urd Bramming (Lucky Lo, Swan Lee, among others), Jonas Wetterslev (The Entrepreneurs, among others), Rasmus Oppenhagen Krogh (Takykardia, Guldimund, among others).</p>\n",

Her songs are filled with the melancholy and contemplation of the nighttime hours. Themes of belonging and finding one's own identity, navigating the challenges of love, being a woman, and all the expectations that come with it are explored. Critics have described Nana as proof that there are still significant and undiscovered talents in jazz. She is a singer with an amazing voice and an approach to music that is both naked, vulnerable, and strong. Her depth of emotion and immediate musicality has been compared to greats like Nina Simone. Nana Rashid's debut album, 'Music For Betty,' was released in 2023.</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

She lets go where others hold on, floating freely through a sonic universe filled with crackling rhythms, flowing 808s, and ethereal synths. From the first listen, you are drawn into ILMA's unique world, where wingspans are broad, waves are high, and expenses are vast. In this broad landscape, the distinctive shapes are genuinely visible and certainly not obscure, allowing you to dive deep into her commanding voice. The music resonates internationally in its genre fusion of pop, hip-hop, R&B, and urban, evoking associations with names like 070 Shake, Don Toliver, and Kehlani.</p>\n<p>With her Bosnian roots, born into a cultural intersection between Sarajevo and Thisted, ILMA found her way into music through Soundcloud, becoming part of an international community that quickly recognized her talent. Since then, she has been connected to music as a producer, performer, and songwriter, resulting in a strong and well-crafted expression. The cultural duality has given her insight and a range of experiences that contribute substance to her profound lyrical universe.</p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",

With only four singles released in 2020, Rambow was named '&Aring;rets Ur&oslash;rt' (Rookie of the Year) by NRK P3 in 2021. That same year, he was seen performing at P3 Gull, and in 2023, he was nominated as &lsquo;Breakthrough of the Year&rsquo; at P3 Gull.

		"description": "<p>Bab L'Bluz (literally \"The door of the Blues\") is a Franco-Moroccan group created in 2018 in Marrakech following the meeting of the Moroccan singer/guitarist Yousra Mansour and the French guitarist / producer Brice Bottin. Passionate about Gnawa music, they decide to learn together the guembri. It is from this French-Moroccan fusion that a new repertoire of 10 tracks of music will be born.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Armed with their electric guembris, Bab L' Bluz resonates a mixture of Gnawa trance rhythms, Hassani songs from southern Morocco and Cha&acirc;bi polyrhythms, propelling their music into the magnetic fields of psychedelic rock and volutes of incense. Led by a woman doukkalia, the group wants to carry a revolution of attitude being part of the movement of the Moroccan youth \"Nayda\", a new wave of artists and committed musicians who are inspired by the local heritage and sing texts of freedom in the Moroccan-Arabic dialect, the darija.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

		"description": "<p>The Danish sister duo PRISMA has been taking the Danish music scene by storm since 2021 with hits like 'I Never Wanted To Meet You' and 'Bangs', as well as their EP 'Inside Out'. Sirid and Frida sing in harmony, blending indie and rock to portray the struggles of youth in a way that has delighted both critics and live audiences. This success has already led to several awards, including a DMA, a Carl Prize, and most recently the 'Nutidens Unge'-award presented by the band tv-2 as part of the Thursday concert before SPOT 2023.</p>\n<p>Currently, PRISMA is promoting their single 'Kingdom'. The song is a sensitive electro-inspired piece with a grand, almost community-oriented chorus.</p>\n<p>PRISMA has not only impressed nationally but has also conquered international stages, appearing at influential festivals such as WayOutWest and Dockville. 2024 is shaping up to be another burgeoning year for PRISMA, who have already solidified their position as one of Denmark's most promising live acts with their unique sound, musical abilities, and special energy on stage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

		"description": "<p>Sofyann Ben Youssef AKA Ammar808 is the mastermind behind the critically acclaimed albums &laquo; Maghreb United &raquo; and &laquo; Global Control / Invisible Invasion &raquo;, not forgetting the late project Bargou08. Before setting base camp in Denmark, he went on an extraordinary journey that made him the godfather of the Tunisian alternative and electronic scene. Bred as a musicologist in the corridors of Tunis&rsquo; Music Institute, he specializes in Arabic and Indian music. As an avid listener, he strives for bridges between oriental and occidental music. This thirst for yet unheard musical blends led him to settle in Vienna, then Brussels, where he met Anana, vocalist and guitarist of the Touareg Band Kel Assouf. Sofyann produced their albums and joined the live band, bringing his sub-harmonic Moog Bass to the Desert Blues cocktail.</p>\n<p>He now operates his own mothership studio in Kjellerup, Denmark, where he works as a composer, producer, sound engineer and music production teacher.</p>\n",

Over Eigil Bj&oslash;rn Meldgaard's productions, which stubbornly explore the borderland between R&B, pop, and trap, Clara Rose Lundberg's ethereal arrangements hover, seducing the listener into UNG-SKAB's world.</p>\n<p>Since the release of their debut EP 'UNG-SKAB' in 2021, the duo has, among other things, sold out the main stage at Pumpehuset and played at 'VEGA's Selection'. In connection with the release of their latest single 'Snakker Lort', the group was featured in DR P3's program series, 'Upcoming'. In March 2023, UNG-SKAB embarked on their first Danish tour, culminating in December at Store VEGA in a resounding sold-out double concert with APHACA.</p>\n<p>UNG-SKAB is groovy, melancholic summer sound. It's the sound of dearest friends and heartache, summer parties, and sunrises.</p>\n",

Elsked leads the way in this movement with their captivating debut EP 'Piratradio'. The title track of &lsquo;Piratradio&rsquo; revolves around removing your life experiences and opening up to a new and fresh consciousness. In many ways, the EP focuses on rethinking oneself, much like the music is a refreshing renewal of the electronic genre in Denmark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsked's sound universe is full of contrasts. The productions are driven intensely by pumping club rhythms, sizzling percussion, and synthesizers that sound both 90s nostalgic and like a distant future simultaneously. The deep vocals and choral arrangements add a grandiose effect, supporting the lyrical themes of love and the art of letting go.</span></p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n<p><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /><br style=\"font-weight: 400;\" /></p>\n",
