The album, an experimental blend of synth-rock, post-punk, and synth-pop, takes listeners on an escapist journey through a woman's confusing attempt to flee from her own emotions.\nMAD MAGPIE draws inspiration from artists such as PULP, Kent, Radiohead, and Depeche Mode. The album feels especially relevant in a world that has changed drastically over the past few months and serves as a continuation of her conceptual debut album, \u2018An Eyewitness Account From The New World\u2019, released in March 2020.",

With a musical depth rarely seen in mainstream pop, she offers everything from high-energy Y2K-style pop bangers to more emotional and reflective sides of herself.\nFormer Off Bloom frontwoman Mette Kathrine Mortensen now steps into the spotlight as a solo artist under the name KATMORE. Her debut single, \u2018Dancing In The Dark\u2019, is, in the artist\u2019s own words, an anthem for getting through dark times. The sound is organic, and the lyrical universe intimate and personal.\nFreja Kirk is an artist who embraces and explores the fundamental human longing and struggle to find one\u2019s identity \u2013 in body, gender, among friends, in grief, and in desire. She manages to channel and nuance this through her honest and soulful pop songs.",

For the concert at SPOT Festival 2025, the orchestra will present works by Veronika Voetmann and Matthew Grouse.\nVeronika Voetmann is a multifaceted musician and composer. Initially playing the classical cello, she soon began to experiment with the cello\u2019s versatility across other genres, such as Nordic folk, improvisation, rock and metal. She has performed and composed in the context of theatre plays and performances, art music concerts and exhibitions. She has also toured nationally and internationally with her own ensembles Stringflip and Cloud Atlas trio, and with various artists such as Myrkur, Marc Facchini and \u00c6ttir. The concert will feature the work \u201cMetaxy\u201d for string quartet.\nComposer, performer and organiser Matthew Grouse often works at an intersection between music for instruments and voices, electronic sound, text, video, and performance. His music regularly engages with a re-contextualisation of everyday sounds, objects, and automatic, repetitive behaviours to reveal the latent musical in the banal. Matthew Grouse is originally from Yorkshire (UK), but is currently living and working in Copenhagen. The work \u201cA very exciting product launch\u201d for quintet, interactive video, audience participation and electronics presents Ensemble Kontrol 2 from the fictional music technology company \u2018Florg\u2019 \u2013 a voice-controlled device that seemingly lets the audience control live music with voice commands. However, the illusion is shattered when it is revealed that a hidden performer is actually controlling the changes, exposing the artificiality of the products and raising questions about authenticity, causality, agency, and control.",

The album follows a tradition rooted in storytelling and contains nods to American folk music, Scandinavian folk, and the rock and blues that have been part of their lives since their youth.

SPOT is packed with amazing, big, small, wild, unforgettable, and sometimes even frustrating live experiences. The quality of a concert can depend on many things: the musicians on stage, the setup of the venue, and of course, the mindset and behavior of the audience. This has led SEIN to ask: what actually is good concert etiquette?\nThat\u2019s why SEINxUMTO invites you to a panel talk on concert culture \u2014 where you can hear four concert-savvy guests share their thoughts on why and how we attend concerts, and what shapes the culture and vibe at each one.\nThe conversation will be moderated by SEIN\u2019s culture editor Laura Rye Bislev, and the panelists are:\n\n\nThomas Beyer, co-manager of the venue turkis\n\n\nMarie H\u00f8jlund, Associate Professor in Sound Studies at Aarhus University\n\n\nFrederik from Rakkerpak, who\u2019ll be performing at UMTOxSPOT Friday night\n\n\nLooking stylish when going to concerts is also a big part of the culture. Just try searching \u201cI shaved my whole body for this concert\u201d on any social media platform and you\u2019ll find countless posts. We\u2019re not asking you to shave anything \u2014 but if you swing by our glam station, you can get a fresh fade, biodegradable glitter on your face, or even a brand-new tattoo(!) \u2014 so you\u2019ll be fully festival-ready.",

Countless hours in the studio have refined his craft, earning him a prominent place among the selected few Danish Afro-artists. He flawlessly delivers his lyrics in both English and Swahili, perfectly complementing the Afro sound. With an unmatched ability to rap, sing, and perform with precision, Tarick stands out as a must-see live performer.\nA deep love for his homeland\u2019s language, culture, and lifestyle runs as a common thread through his music. His songs beautifully capture the many facets of youth - love, infatuation, and emotions - while also reflecting on his roots and the society he is part of.\nTarick has personally experienced the feeling of being a stranger, no matter where he is. These experiences fuel his mission to bridge people together and inspire movement with love rather than hate. Through his inspiring lyrics and uplifting perspective on even the heaviest topics, Tarick offers a bright outlook and a relentless \u201ckeep your head up\u201d spirit. All of this is elegantly wrapped in warm rhythms, delivered with a confident belief that people will dance along, even when the themes carry significant depth.",

        "description": "ETVA turns her gaze inward, toward what\u2019s been hidden away. Blending raw Danish electropop with soul-wrenching indie, she shares herself with the audience in a stripped-down, honest, and intimate space where every emotion is welcome. Her music and lyrics reflect a person with visible cracks in the surface, bathed in tears, yet carrying the willpower to stand up for herself - and for what often feels wrong. With deep humility, she makes an honest attempt to be the voice that so many silence within themselves.\nETVA is one of the 10 selected artists in DR\u2019s KarriereKanonen 2025, with her song \u2018H\u00e6vet over larm\u2019 - an atmospheric indie-pop anthem that captures the feeling of drifting out of the mind\u2019s shadowy thoughts and rediscovering oneself. She has previously participated in the Royalties talent development program, performed live at venues like Loppen, URBAN 13, and Way Up North Festival, and was formerly signed to a major label - a path she has since chosen to walk away from in favor of creative independence.\nLook forward to experiencing her live, as she casts a spotlight on forgotten feelings with vulnerable, powerful intensity.",

        "description": "Damkapellet is a professional collective of musicians and composers with a mission to promote diversity and inclusion in the Danish music scene. They perform music by women, non-binary, and transgender people, and they experiment with collective co-creation of music rooted in the broad spectrum of art music \u2013 from contemporary composition and improvisation to opera, baroque, and children's performances. At their concert at SPOT Festival 2025, the ensemble will present works by Kirstine Lindemann, Greta Eacott, Tine Surel Lange, and a collectively composed piece.\nInstrumentalist, composer and performer Kirstine Lindemann (b. 1987) is interested in the space between you and me. In the field of tension between symbiosis, synchronicity, empathy \u2013 discrepancy, alienation and friction, she explores the drive towards the other \u2013 as a primordial force and existential conflict. The work \u201cFors\u00f8g i Gentagelser\u201d (\u201cattempts in repetitions\u201d) is an investigation of the transformation in repetition. With a few notes, the music travels between the voices with a repetition that bends, twists, stretches and pushes the music into a recurring question about how we, in harmony with others, can separate, flow together and perhaps change?\n\u201cEn skog av lyd\u201d (\u201cA forest of sound\u201d) is a sound work composed by the Danish-Norwegian composer Tine Surel Lange (b. 1989) for Damkapellet. The work is inspired by how individual, scattered trees slowly grow together to form a forest, and by how the fungus mycorrhiza functions as a symbiotic network between plant roots, enabling mutual communication, exchanging nutrients and warning each other of dangers.\nBritish/Swedish composer Greta Eacott (b. 1990) is known for her uninhibited approach to composition and her experimental percussion works. The fourth installment of Greta Eacott\u2019s \u201cGESTALT MINIMAL\u201d series, is a long form one note composition written especially for Damkapellet. Expect a frissonistic and pummeling rhythmic massage.\n\u201cSignature\u201d, a work composed collectively in Damkapellet, is a listening organism that examines the friction of the individual in a collective perspective. The musicians become the composers and vice versa. Each contributes their unique voice and perspective. The work is a dynamic experience in a mission to create cohesion between musicians and audience. The work is composed by Josefine Weber Hansen, Irene Bianco, Nadia Okrusko, Nicole Hogstrand, Randi Pontoppidan, Mika Persdotter, Julija Morgan, Kirstine Lindemann, Pauline Hogstrand and Tove Bagge.",

Her debut release, \u2018Ambulance\u2019, had a flying start with great reviews, playlist placements, and radio plays. In the song, Gunge visualizes a classic youth scenario of being chosen over for someone else, set in the streets of Copenhagen.\nDrawing from personal experiences of a bittersweet and turbulent youth, Gunge writes honest songs in Danish, carried by a quirky and vivid language that combines both melancholy and self-irony.\nGunge began her music career in a small, closed-off basement studio in \u00d8sterbro. In meeting a hip-hop collective that wanted to use her for hooks, the Copenhagen-based Gunge realized that not everything in music had to be polished, and that box wine and hand-rolled cigarettes could also belong in a great pop hook. Later, she found a musical collaboration with co-producer and artist Daniel Joy, who could mirror her fascination with pop music in a version that is just as hard-hitting and emotional as hip-hop.\nLive, Gunge creates an intense and intimate experience, where her strong vocals and dynamic band transform the songs into something greater. Her debut, including supporting Ella Augusta on tour, has already attracted attention, and there is no doubt that audiences can expect a special experience when Gunge takes the stage.",

But he did - he just didn\u2019t quite know yet what made him different. It\u2019s only within the past year that KEDDE has found a safe place to land, where he now fully understands and embraces being queer\u2014both within himself and openly with the world.\nKEDDE has since found his home in Copenhagen - a place where it feels more acceptable to stand out, and where he can see reflections of himself on nearly every street corner. And that has made him brave.\nIn 2023, KEDDE performed at Smukfest, where he won the Tak Rock Award. He has also toured with Mekdes and Pil, performed at Copenhagen Pride on the City Hall Square, and played shows at Tivoli, SPOT Festival, Jelling Festival, and more. His song \u2018S\u00e5dan m\u00e5 det v\u00e6re\u2019 was chosen as P3\u2019s Unavoidable Track at the beginning of 2024.\nNow, KEDDE is entering a brand-new chapter with his song \u2018Dagdr\u00f8mmeri\u2019. His music has always been personal, but it has never been this honest - or this queer. For the first time, KEDDE has found exactly where he belongs. A place where he feels understood, and where he feels mature and confident enough to write the songs that truly matter.\nThe vibe is \u201cacoustic in the club\u201d, and KEDDE has fallen in love with the guitar - especially the acoustic one, which allows him to tell stories in a whole new way.",

Their music highlights a cross-section between euphoria and melancholy that resides in all of us: Feeling alone even when surrounded by your best friends or feeling inadequate even at 1000 kilometers per hour.\nThe duo is set to release an EP later this year, with the first single, \u2018The Nerve,\u2019 already out on the record label M\u00f8s M\u00f8s. They released their debut EP, \u2018Intrude,\u2019 in the spring of 2023, and it was the group's first major release since their debut concert at SPOT Festival 2022, which GAFFA rewarded with four stars under the headline \u2018Electropop-duo surprises to dazzling debut.\u2019 The band has also received airplay on both P6 Beat and P3, recorded a cover of JoJo\u2019s \u2018Too Little Too Late,\u2019 and released a music video for the song \u2018Blindspot.\u2019",

Now they return as a duo consisting of Alexander and Laura, while bassist Lasse continues as an \"invisible\" part of the group. This shift has allowed them to reflect on their music and discover a new direction that resonates more deeply with their innermost emotions.\nTheir first single, \u2018Breakup Season\u2019 (October 2024), takes listeners on an emotional journey through the challenges of autumn romance. The song blends country and folk elements with a fresh groove and is inspired by their own and their friends' experiences with breakups and life's tougher moments. This marks a new chapter for Basel\u00f8s\u2014a sense of renewal that runs through their upcoming EP, \u2018T\u00e6nk hvad vi ku blive\u2019 created in collaboration with friends from bands like Dusin and Undertekst.",

The project is a clash between country and disco, arrangement and intuition, sincerity and stupidity in a 00\u2019s fighting game arena, where the sharp pixelated edges are smoothed over by a dense mist.\nThe fog leaves you stumbling through blurry sonics and unclear narratives circling estrangement, strandedness and Sisyphean perseverance. Blindly, your hand catches a thread. Cutting through the ethereal is a trail of clear-cut melodies, simple percussive synthesizers, vocal harmonies and sharp song structures maintaining direction and form.\nIn late 2024, the first of a new breed of songs from the quartet, \u2018Mechanical Heart\u2019, emerged. A departure from the prior Dream Pop sound, the reclusive disco-rock track charts a grittier, darker path ahead for the group with several additional releases planned for 2025.",

Forr\u00e6der is Viktor\u2019s solo project, where the same intensity is expressed in a new, intimate format. Here, the music moves effortlessly across genres, unfolding in a na\u00efve tension between longing and contempt, between hope and restlessness, and between trust and betrayal.",

Jansson and Spasov met while studying jazz at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm, bonding over playing Burt Bacharach and Beatles songs and their shared love for Stranger Things and Big Thief. They had ambitions to make their musical partnership something larger than life itself, which led them to invite their fellow Royal College of Music student, Eklind, and Spasov\u2019s friend, Lindberg, to complete the band\u2019s lineup.\nGirl Scout has been compared to everything from The Breeders to Snail Mail while bringing a sonic finesse that often surpasses these names in vivid technicolor 4K.\nThe band released their second EP, \u2018Granny Music\u2019, in 2023\u2014a five-track collection that continued their unique sound, supported by the single \u2018Boy in Blue\u2019. Their latest EP release, \u2018Headache\u2019 (2024), further builds on their solid and exciting discography.\nFew bands manage to create daring, mesmerizing noise without compromising melody, but Jansson and Spasov\u2019s songwriting chemistry has resulted in impeccable, unexpected algorithms within their work. Their songs rarely take predictable paths, yet somehow they sound both traditional and electrifying, as if crafted by any young, hungry alt-rock band with the resources to aim high.\nStarting a band these days can be almost impossibly challenging, and creating truly great music is even harder. Girl Scout seems to have cracked the code. Their path forward appears limitless. Perhaps the moon is the only landing spot for Jansson, Spasov, Lindberg, and Eklind\u2014or maybe even that is too short a distance.",

It is a captivating sibling anthem with hints of R&B and indie pop, as well as a recognizable inspiration from the timeless disco classic \u2018We Are Family\u2019 by Sister Sledge.\nWhen 22-year-old Lea and 23-year-old Samuel write, record, and produce their infectious R&B indie pop together, they tap into a dynamic energy that defines ORA. Their music is rooted in personal storytelling, with Jonathan Elk\u00e6r from Phlake as a steady presence in the producer\u2019s chair.\nORA, named after their grandmother and meaning \"the light of the sun,\" released their debut single, Bad Day, in August last year. It received praise from influential media outlets such as \u2018Ones To Watch\u2019 in the USA, Belgian platform \u2018Dansende Beren\u2019, and the UK culture site \u2018tmrw magazine\u2019, while their follow-up single, \u2018Space Rock\u2019, made it onto P3. In other words, there is every reason to keep a close eye on ORA in 2025.",

Before he started running, he had a vast amount of creative energy and a strong urge to create, but he didn't know how to unleash it or find the strength to turn it into reality. Running still provides him with the necessary clarity and energy to create his own music.\nOn November 1, 2024, School of X released his third studio album, \u2018Seventh Heaven\u2019. The album explores the pursuit of absolute happiness and perfection as a utopia while holding onto the hope of reaching it. During the recording process, Littauer changed direction by bringing a new band into the studio and handing over the producer role to S\u00f8ren Buhl Lassen. This allowed for a renewed focus on songwriting and captured the intense live energy of School of X's concerts.\nThe album has received praise for its grand indie-pop sound. GAFFA described it as a \"magnificent celestial journey with an all-or-nothing pop album that quickly takes flight.\" Soundvenue highlighted the combination of longing lyrics and energetic songwriting, creating a sense of fresh air and wind in the hair as the adrenaline rushes forward.",

This dynamic organ trio breathes new life into the classic organ trio tradition with a fresh Scandinavian touch. Their diverse musical backgrounds merge into an energetic expression best described as Scandinavian jazz-rock.",

        "description": "Rapper/producer Skt. DeLarge has previously been called \"something as rare as an original in the hip-hop world\" and has impressed and surprised the Danish underground scene since 2020 with his expressive yet thoughtful blend of alternative rap, noise, and digital hardcore.\nHis satirical staging and experimental, distorted musical universe is infused with anger and fragility, as he tackles topics such as toxic masculinity, xenophobia, capitalism, and uncritical popular culture. What remains is a person shouting at a broken world, aware that he is part of the destruction.\nIn 2022, Skt. DeLarge released the EP \u2018Super Ego\u2019, which was praised by both listeners and critics. Since then, he has shown significant creative development through aggressively introspective singles like \u2018HEYOAH\u2019 and \u2018LILLESPEJL\u2019, which have led to a series of well-received live shows across Denmark and the opportunity to support international acts such as Denzel Curry and Danny Brown.",

Her debut single, \u2018Honey\u2019, burst onto Danish radio as P3\u2019s \u201cUnavoidable Track of The Week\u201d, and in early 2025, Emily released her debut album, \u2018Hate Me For This\u2019. The organic pop album is infused with the lived experiences of the 20-year-old newcomer. Written like a diary, the songs reveal pages full of confessions, truths, pain, smiles, humor, and an honest, vulnerable openness to the first-time experiences we all face from birth to death.\nThe aforementioned debut single, \u2018Honey\u2019, set the stage in spring 2024 with its charming, noisy indie-pop vibe and lyrics that read like a diary entry. While the song appeared to reflect a friend\u2019s destructive thoughts and chaotic life, it ultimately pointed back to the songwriter herself. In her creative exploration, Emily\u2019s empathetic and curious nature led her to new studios and collaborators. Among them was producer Rasmus S\u00f8egren (known for work with eee gee, Dopha, Hjalmer, and more), whose meticulous, innovative approach to music became the perfect match for Emily\u2019s debut album.\nOver the past year, Emily Bowen\u2019s music has taken root on the live scene as well, with a performance at Smukfest and a supporting tour with English band Maximo Park. Danish online magazine Soundvenue has also named her one of the 15 most promising artists of 2025.",

Their second album, 'And Then There Were None' (2021), released by Napalm Records, had a darker and more ambitious sound, resonating with both fans and critics.\nOn their latest record, LIVL\u00d8S continue to deliver their crushing style - a blend of heavy grooves, melancholic melodies, and progressive musicianship - while unfolding a cosmological, fantasy-inspired narrative about 'The Crescent King,' a symbol of humanity, its psyche, and its cycle in the universe. Ambition, form, and content merge beautifully on 'The Crescent King.'",

They embrace bright, pastel-colored melodies and grand chords while a deep blue melancholy floats through their bubblegum landscapes.\nIt\u2019s a kind of Eurodance mixed with Nordic Noir and Danish irony. Together, they are both playful and bigger than life. And they create a space where there\u2019s room to feel blue and room to be on. Where, with slushy eyes, you can raise a finger in the air and let yourself be absorbed into their sugar-coated, neon-colored, and cathartic darkroom.",

R\u00f8nnenfelt, renowned as the frontman and lyricist of Iceage, is known for a sound of his own which is dreamy yet bombastic, fragile yet tough, continually evolving while staying rooted in his fearless artistry.\nIn October, the singer unveiled his debut solo album \u2018Heavy Glory\u2019, released via Escho, co-produced with Nis Bysted and featuring collaborators like Iceage\u2019s Dan Kj\u00e6r Nielsen, punk legend Peter Peter, and vocalists Joanne Robertson and Fauzia. The album boasts a dynamic and atmospheric sound and it is a raw, genre-defying exploration of love, chaos, and resilience, capturing the essence of growing up by diving headfirst into life, anchored by R\u00f8nnenfelt\u2019s ever-present pen and guitar. Born during the uncertain post-pandemic haze of 2022, \u2018Heavy Glory\u2019 emerged as a collection of songs written and tested on the road in forests, chapels, and living rooms across Europe.\nElias R\u00f8nnenfelt is never afraid to examine the complexities of human connection, from desperate longing to tender surrender. With tracks like \u2018Unarmed\u2019 and \u2018Stalker\u2019 he presents a deeply personal yet universal narrative.",

        "description": "Embla and the Karidotters is a project by former Razika drummer Embla Karidotter. After the successful Norwegian indie band went on hiatus, Embla gathered her \"Karidotters\" from talented bands like Honningbarna, Sl\u00f8tface, Slomosa, and Aiming for Enrike. They quickly began playing concerts and recording music.\nThe renowned producer Matias Tellez was behind the band's first two releases, but on their latest album, \u2018Off Leash\u2019, they did everything themselves, with multi-instrumentalist Simen F\u00f8lstad Nilsen producing and mixing the album.\nThe band's second album continues their \u201chonky tonk noir\u201d sound, with references to Ennio Morricone, Nancy Sinatra, and David Lynch films, featuring lyrics that are humorous, self-deprecating, and melancholic. Karidotter describes the release as having a detached relationship with country, in the sense that they don\u2019t worry about what is right or wrong within the genre, while still drawing inspiration from classic country rock of the 1950s and 1960s.",

Ludvig III project began to take shape during Jonathan's days at the conservatory in Aarhus, where he explored the interplay between complex drumming and anxious, introspective songwriting.\nIn 2021, he released his debut album, \u2018Sadboy Fusion\u2019, showcasing the results of this exploration: hectic and provocatively off-kilter beats cycling alongside Jonathan's bright, angelic, autotuned voice. It\u2019s an extreme contrast between vulnerability and strength, also evident in his live performances, where he turns his back to the audience, exposing his bare back while battling with his instrument.\nIn 2024, J. Ludvig III returned with his second album, \u2018EMOTAN\u2019, a tribute to his former self and a desire to defy expectations. It\u2019s a grand breakup album that throws the listener through a whirlwind of genre references, all held together by Jonathan\u2019s anxious vocals, seemingly on the verge of breaking. On \u2018EMOTAN\u2019, J. Ludvig III uses his myriad influences as a tool to tell a bigger story, both musically and personally.",

Even with only a few releases under their belt, the band has already set the tone for their activist and musical journey. It\u2019s an ambitious project, featuring collaborations across genres and artistic expressions\u2014clearly, this journey has only just begun.",

Now she\u2019s back\u2014with new songs about life, its tempo, being present, and being in motion. And about Stenslag\u2014not just as a song title.\nRenay\nThe sound and the voice are anything but typically Danish\u2014soulful, funky, warm, and authentic, with deep roots in the very best of the international scene. But the man himself is firmly grounded in Jutland, his musical and Danish-African heart always beating for the big leagues \u201cover there.\u201d And luckily, Renay lives up to all of it.\nLoud Tiger\nShe\u2019s written songs for huge stars, toured the world, and spent 11 years in London and LA. Her voice and songwriting are top-tier, and yet, you might not know her\u2014yet. But you will. Meet Viktoria Siff aka LOUD TIGER.\nThe Mukherjee Development\n\u201cLike Danish Coldplay\u2014just better than the original,\u201d GAFFA wrote in a five-star concert review. This indie, rock, and folk band invites both introspection and celebration in a world that moves too fast.\nJesper Lindell (SE)\nJesper Lindell blends soul, rock, and Americana with a voice full of longing and strength. After a promising football career ended due to injury at 13, he found his calling in music, inspired by legends like The Band and Van Morrison. A modern Nordic troubadour with an international sound and deep authenticity.\nSchedule\n13:00 \u2013 13:20: Marie Frank13:40 \u2013 14:00: Renay14:20 \u2013 14:40: Loud Tiger15:00 \u2013 15:20: The Mukherjee Development15:40 \u2013 16:20: Jesper Lindell (SE)",

You\u2019ll be taken by the hand, launched into outer space, but also brought right back down to earth - and if you squint your eyes, they might just be mistaken for a star.\nEmil Bror's songs are seen through lenses tinted by the choices one must make when standing face to face with the rest of their life. The knot in the chest, the fear of the future, and the question - who is really looking back when you see yourself in the mirror?\nEmil Bror is in a constant and never-ending search for inspiration and the next great idea. He isn\u2019t afraid to wear his biggest influences on his sleeve, and when you see him perform, there is no doubt that legendary artists like David Bowie, Harry Styles, and Prince have left a deep mark on him. His playful and explorative approach to fashion, makeup, and - most of all - music is a defining trait, as he continuously pushes new boundaries to see just how far he can go.",

And KROGEN shares that same urge to do things his own way.\nThe musical legacy of Waylon was evident on KROGEN\u2019s 2022 debut album, \u2018Henover Lakken\u2019 - a festive, rebellious, and at times heartfelt tribute to everything that makes country music iconic.

The album explores themes of identity, the nice girl complex, the struggle to be true to oneself, societal expectations of what a \"real girl/woman\" should be, and the courage to follow one\u2019s heart. Throughout the album, you can hear the influence of Jessie Ka\u2019s major inspirations, including M\u00d8, Robyn, Lydmor, and Tove Lo.\nHowever, the live stage is where Jessie Ka\u2019s heart truly lies. In addition to headlining concerts and performing at various festivals, she has also supported artists such as Tessa, Lydmor, and Jacob Bellens.",

It\u2019s an almost tactile musical experience for both audience and musicians, where the line between performer and listener is blurred; everyone is gathered together on the floor, creating an atmosphere of closeness that enhances the musical interplay.

Instead, Maja Kj\u00e6r si Orkester aims to turn expectations upside down. The piano is replaced by a cimbalom, the bass by a tuba, and the percussion blends primal earthiness with the delicate feel of winter mornings. The violins form the link to Scandinavian folk traditions, and together this oddball ensemble offers a glorious opportunity to dial up or down the Nordic and Eastern European vibes according to mood and moment.",

Through experimental microphone setups, the saxophone\u2019s hidden acoustic properties are amplified, unfolding into otherworldly and crystal-clear explorations of the instrument\u2019s possibilities. From distorted, almost aggressive percussive sequences played on the valves to rustling noise, where amplified delicacy reveals hypnotic, subtle overtones.\nThe playful appeal of Michaela Turcerov\u00e1's \u2018IN FLUX\u2019, which could easily work as sound design for a surrealist animated film, lies in its exposed physicality - of both the instruments and the performer. On her solo debut, the Denmark-based Slovakian musician digs through the inertia of the modulated saxophone, found objects and a variety of toys. Turcerov\u00e1 examines their percussive traits with childlike rudimentary eagerness. Moreover, there is an erratic sense of humor, which alters the release in unexpected ways.",

But after a few years away from music for deep personal reflection, he has reinvented himself and created the project Eezy. His music now reflects a more honest and authentic identity\u2014a transformation that cements Eezy as an artist worth keeping an eye on.\nEezy\u2019s sound stands out through a unique blend of powerful beats and personal lyrics, creating a deep and motivating experience for listeners. His music is both inspiring and moving, while maintaining a grounded, relatable tone\u2014enhanced by rocky and soulful samples.\nOn his debut single, \u2018Topfart\u2019, you can feel the raw emotion and depth that now define his work. He has since followed up with releases like \u2018SNAK/MILANO\u2019, \u2018Vi\u2019 Op\u2019, \u2018Hustlers Ambition\u2019, and most recently the Kundo collaboration \u2018Corner\u2019, which drew attention from outlets like Soundvenue, calling it his best single to date.\nEezy continues to deliver outstanding examples of what hip hop can sound like in 2025.",

It's colossal yet heartfelt as FooN invites listeners into their sonic doomsday landscape.\nOn the live scene, FooN has toured extensively across Scandinavia and the UK, earning high praise from audiences and critics alike. Their shows have been described as capable of making any stage resonate like a stadium, with an energy built for the grandest arenas.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the band has shared the stage with prominent live acts like Black Foxxes, Odd Palace, and Forever Still. In 2024, FooN signed with Last Mile Records and, in September of the same year, released the single \u2018Bloodstream\u2019 featuring Adam Rigozzi from UK band Lastelle. This marks the band\u2019s first step into a new era, showcasing a heavier, darker, and more explosive sound.",

The Copenhagen quintet, consisting of two saxophones, guitar, bass, and drums, defies genre boundaries. Their sound alternates between hypnotic repetition and intense, euphoric energy, drawing inspiration from alternative rock, spiritual jazz, and minimalism.\u00a0\nThis spring Nausia released their new album \u2018Finding a Circle\u2019 (Vasen, 2025), which the band describes as the culmination of five years of hard work on tours and releases. Created in close collaboration with producer Jacob G\u00fcnther, the album reflects a strong musical camaraderie and a desire to find solace amidst the storm of turbulent youth, climate collapse, and dystopian futures. Expect a work that is spiritual, intense, jazzy, doomy, and cohesive - cementing Nausia as a profoundly original band in constant development and one of Denmark\u2019s most compelling jazz-rock acts.\u00a0\nWhen Nausia last played SPOT Festival in 2022, the legendary rock journalist David Fricke dryly\u00a0 after the concert remarked, \"It's hard to beat this one.\" Now, three years later, Nausia returns after releasing a brand new album and they are looking forward to blowing both the bowling hall and SPOT away.",

With her playful approach to the Danish language, Stella Darla is unafraid to quote Medina and reference sexual abuse in the same song.\nBehind Stella Darla is singer, songwriter, and producer Emilie Ohrt, who was previously part of the dreampop duo Audrey and has written music for and appeared in the film \u2018Bl\u00e5t Lys\u2019. However, it is as Stella Darla that she has found her most personal stories as a songwriter. Stella Darla's debut album, \u2018Miss Nordjylland\u2019, was released in November 2024 through Playground Music.\nOn stage, she is accompanied by a band that, with its combination of acoustic guitar, synthesizers, and vocal harmonies, creates a space that accommodates both the acoustic and the ethereal. It\u2019s like waking up in the middle of the night and turning on a film you\u2019ve never seen before, but somehow, you feel like you know it.",

Her accompaniment is characterized by subtle yet insistent guitar work, complemented by violin, double bass, flutes, and soaring vocal harmonies.\nWen\u00f8e\u2019s latest album \u2018Undersea\u2019 was released in 2023 to glowing international reviews and received airplay on BBC Radio and numerous independent stations around the world. The album has since been followed by concerts in Sweden and Denmark, and in autumn 2024, she will embark on a longer tour through England and Wales.\nShe has also released an EP and a mini-album as part of the creative collaboration \u2018Whates & Wen\u00f8e\u2019 with Samantha Whates.

Lyrics, music, and storytelling should serve as an outlet for frustration and anger while also providing authentic insight into the life circumstances of minorities. In this way, the lyrics take on a constructive role for both sender and receiver. Marwan and the rest of SORTHANDSK have consciously chosen to channel all their emotions into works that can spark debate and show future generations that there are alternatives to burning the system down.\nA pact has been made between SORTHANDSK and their audience - to unite around what truly matters. This becomes evident once the layers of frustration and anger settle, leaving hope still resonating in Marwan\u2019s voice. The authenticity is striking in its expression. It is the language of the streets and the underground, but it is also deeply human - the human experience, with all its flaws and shortcomings, yet with an unrelenting urge to do better than before. The lyrics are both ruthless and heartfelt. They leave no one untouched by the relentless energy and will for change that drive them.\nSORTHANDSK may hit hard, but they also have the power to elevate listeners to new realizations and into a warm community where even the most difficult emotional struggles are embraced.",

One might ask when looking at the clownlike 3D rendered face on the front cover of the new LP from composer, bassist and vocalist Ida Duelund.\u00a0\nSibo is a celebration of poetry and fantasy. A gentle dadaistic work where Duelund moves effortlessly, almost ruthlessly through musical history and genres as if mixing a bag of fantastical lollies. She reminisces both the jazz standards from Broadway, the choral works of Hildegard von Bingens middleages, impressionistic classical composition and modern improvisation. Playfully and carefree.\nFor SPOT Festival, Duelund has gathered a sextet of remarkable musicians from very different corners of the Danish jazz- and experimental music scene. Together they will interpret Sibo in a musical collage where improvisations weave in and out between Duelund\u2019s surrealistic songs and childlike compositions.\u00a0\nAs musician and composer, Duelund is an integral part of the Copenhagen music scene and wanders freely between experimental music, pop- and rock, and the established jazz and improvised music scenes. She has in recent years collaborated with artists like Marilyn Mazur, Jada, Baby In Vain, Hess is More, Pia Raug, Barbro, Astrid Engberg, Kresten Osgood, just to name a few, and she is co-founder of the experimental string duo Lueenas. Recipient of the Tivoli Jazz Price in 2023 for her work as a musician.",

The work explores being stuck in time, relationships and unresolved feelings, and the songs could be described as like a single stream of thought, with no emotional resolution, beginning or end. Alba\u2019s first release is set to come this year, however most recently she\u2019s been featured on the record of the artist GB, \u201cGusse Music\u2019\u201d (Posh Isolation, 2024), where she\u2019s done backing vocals on a number of songs.",

His career began in childhood when he played major roles on Danish theater stages. In recent years, he has focused primarily on his career as a singer and songwriter, and in the fall of 2024, he released the EP \u2018Affogato\u2019.\nThe sound he has developed is far removed from mainstream pop, residing in a condensed universe of melancholic moods, raw guitars, and an atypical, timeless love for analog recording and live-played instruments.\nElliot\u2019s narrative explores a young life filled with inner and outer pressures. Embracing the darkness that accompanies him, his music tells an honest story of rebelling against the world\u2019s expectations and daring to stand as his true self. The new songs are entirely Elliot\u2019s own, and much more music is on the way in 2025.",

The EP has already left its mark on the harsh environments of youth, disarming them and instead finding comfort in the moon rather than weapons when the world shows its merciless side. With the song \u2018Run Away\u2019, LAY captivated listeners with his melodies and flows over the heart-pounding R&B beat.\nSince his debut EP, he has grown stronger in his belief that his path in music should be self-sustaining rather than tied to major label deals. As a result, Problembarn Records is now the partially self-owned label through which LAY releases his music. In 2024, he played his first headlining concerts with a full band, including a sold-out show at Huset and a performance at Forbr\u00e6ndingen. In the fall, he was part of the support lineup for USSEL\u2019s entire tour\u2014could this exciting connection spark a chemical reaction?

The themes in Funder\u2019s music are deeply rooted in emotional and relational turbulence, and her reflective and honest songwriting captures the intense complexity of close relationships. She sings about the unspoken things that trouble and scare us\u2014how we connect to and become dependent on one another. As music magazine GAFFA put it: \"Few Danish artists can weave the anxiety of difficult relationships into such delicate sonic patterns as Karoline Funder.\"\nWhen Karoline Funder released her debut single, \u2018Vores Forhandling\u2019, in March 2024, it was met with overwhelming praise. With just two singles out, she made her live debut at the festival Syd For Solen in the summer of 2024 and in the fall, she followed up with her third single, \u2018Jeg Hader At Jeg T\u00e6nkte At Du Lignede En Engel\u2019, a precursor to her upcoming EP set for release in early 2025. Funder has also been selected as one of six artists for VEGA's Udvalgte 2025, marking her as a standout talent to watch.",

Dark guitar elements, expressive synth layers, and a melodic, yearning vocal create a grand, unpolished, and authentic sound that fills a unique gap in the Danish music scene.\nFollowing a nationwide tour and the release of their debut single \u2018Skipped a Step\u2019\u2014which gained regular rotation on P6 Beat, Amazing Radio in New York and London, as well as airplay on BBC1\u2014the rising rock quartet has expanded their discography with another single. The brand-new track, \u2018Fall Behind\u2019, showcases a different side of the band's musical universe. Serving as both a lyrical and sonic contrast to their earlier releases, \u2018Fall Behind\u2019 is introspective, reflective, and unpredictable. It carries a quiet frustration that unexpectedly erupts into a desperate, all-consuming force. The song pushes the boundaries of the rock genre in terms of dynamics and conventions, weaving in influences from shoegaze, grunge, and alt-pop, once again cementing B\u00c6NCH as an innovative and powerful name on both the Danish and international rock scenes.",

Their sound is grand and theatrical, yet simultaneously intimate and stripped-down. It\u2019s a universe wrapped in layers of synths, airy vocals, and experimental guitar roles, with Berghamar\u2019s lyrics serving as an anchor for the listener. With an insistent presence, the most challenging, profound, and contradictory emotions are addressed through an understated yet direct language. Adopting a curious approach to production, the band strives to push the boundaries of their own understanding of genre - still, beneath it all lies a constant love for the classic, well-crafted pop song.\nKayak aims to challenge the conventional pop listener. But they also want to reach you - right in the midst of those emotions you\u2019re not alone in feeling, or perhaps didn\u2019t even know you had.",

In the band Damar, the musicians go straight to the source, playing this side of folk music from Bosnia, Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria, blended with the group\u2019s own songs.\nDamar was founded by Emir Pasic, who came to Denmark in 1992 as a refugee from the war in the former Yugoslavia. He arrived at a refugee camp in Thisted, where there was little to do. Instead of just sitting around, he began writing songs inspired by Balkan folk music.\nThe first result was the band Kurve, which played a punk-infused and intense Balkan sound across the country and throughout Europe for the next ten years. However, the more calm and atmospheric music stayed with him, and in 2020, Damar was formed by Emir (guitar and vocals) together with Adnan Oprasic (bass), who is also from Bosnia, Lotte Maxild (Singvogel) on clarinet, and Michael Andersen (UFO Yepha) on drums.\nFor Damar, it is essential not to westernize the music but to play it in its original form \u2013 in sound, atmosphere, and melodies \u2013 with a simple instrumentation.",

The lyrics paint a picture of a lazy, antisocial, and self-ironic protagonist in a feel-bad indie universe. There\u2019s a balance between sarcasm and melancholy in nonchalant and charming songs about personal inadequacy.\nThe first single, \u2018Legs,\u2019 has been well-received on the Danish music scene, with airtime on the radio station P6 BEAT and coverage in the cultural magazine Soundvenue which described the song as \"a charming, scrappy dose of indie rock with snarky deadpan humor \u00e0 la Rhian Teasdale from Wet Leg.\"\nLook forward to an intimate and dynamic live experience as Dork invites you into her melancholic world.",

His debut double-single, \u2018Dr\u00f8mmer / Helt\u2019, offers the first glimpse into a sonic universe that explores mental vulnerability, the absurdity of existence, and the inevitable beauty found within life's chaos.\nMathias Ranch's solo project is a new beginning\u2014but not a break from the past.

Since then, she\u2019s been working intensely on new music and evolving her sound in bold new directions. She has teased several new tracks on TikTok, where she\u2019s built a large and loyal community of fans who are deeply engaged in her creative process.\nThe song \u2018Koldblodet Killer\u2019 became a turning point for Berg. After going viral on TikTok, and following massive demand, she released it on February 7th, 2025. Without a label backing her, the track has already racked up hundreds of thousands of streams and landed in the Top 50 - proving that Berg is an artist you simply won\u2019t be able to ignore on the Danish music scene.",

With the release of their second album \u2018GENSTART\u2019 in 2022, they firmly cemented their position, as both radio and streaming platforms warmly embraced the title track and the rest of the release.\nMost recently, PATINA has opened a new chapter with the album \u2018Uvejr\u2019, where the music weaves connections between inner emotional landscapes and the outer movements of the world - focusing on all the things we can\u2019t always control. \u2018Uvejr\u2019 is a two-part release, with part 1 arriving in October 2024 as a prelude to the full album, which will be released on May 2, 2025. Audiences can thus look forward to an unofficial album release at SPOT 2025.\nThe band is known for its uncompromising approach to both songwriting and live performances. With a unique setup of three front members - Gregers, S\u00f8ren, and Mads -\u00a0 who take turns singing, playing drums, and percussion, PATINA balances on the edge of chaos - a chaos that is not just part of their sound, but a core element of their artistic identity. Their creative process is marked by a search for honesty and authenticity, where nothing is predictable and anything can happen. The music becomes a reflection of the human condition - both in the storm and in the stillness.\nThe band\u2019s expression is anchored by regular members Toke Lynggaard Larsen and Mathias B\u00f8ttern on guitar, Frederik Bak on bass, and Jens M\u00f8ller Jensen on organ and keys. Together, they create a sonic space where energy and vulnerability go hand in hand.\nAutumn 2024 featured an extensive tour across Denmark, and this summer PATINA is once again ready to take over the Danish festival stages with their characteristic, devil-may-care live energy.",
