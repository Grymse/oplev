# Oplev

A platform for experiencing festival programs in a fun and interactive way. Bringing the music program to attendees in an interactive manner gives way for a ton of convenience features along with allowing the ability to explore unknown territories. Currently, the software uses a tinder-approach, which simply replicates the Tinder swiping mechanism with different content. A user can therefor dismiss, like and superlike content.

## Vision

On the long run, the platform is intended to be an interactive way to approach a large variety of cultural experiences. This means any event from visiting an aquarium, to experiencing sound therapy, to exploring a music catalogue and more. This way, we have a central hub for exploring what actually gives life to a city and to life itself.

We strive to be the main portal of distributing events and may serve as a commercializing platform for large vendors like Ticketmaster and other platforms. We do not intend to sell tickets, but redirect users to other sales platforms.

The idea came to my head while traveling to south east asia, where visiting a new city came at the expense of google and searching for fun things to do. Unfortunately, search and results were typically filled with tourist traps and non-important stuff. This made the local culture hard to get in touch with.

## Project

## Wish to contribute?
Any contribution is always appreciated. I continuously attempt to keep issues sorted properly to make it easier to get in touch with the project. Before attacking problems that deal with the design of the software, it would be wise to get in contact with me, such that your time is best spent, and we don't develop in different directions! The creative vision is not as spelled out, and any cool feature request is ALWAYS appreciated!

### Design
The design strives for absolute **simplicity**. This helps ease users into the platform. If we can borrow design elements from existing massive apps, then that is the preferred way to do it, since we do not want to redo all that work! There is no Figma, as many of the details are simply a result of prototyping. This gives way for multiple people to affect the vision, but risks contradicting visions. To save time, we have opted only for sketching privately, and then trying to implement that directly. Stick to issues and communicate design ideas before implementing, then you should be good to go!

The design is based on the Skeleton UI library. This allows for extensive customizability, which provides different partners to express their brand.
